# ðŸš€ Fawry Internship Task Solutions

> **Note:**  
> Each question's solution is organized inside its own folder.

Hello! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository contains my solutions for the two technical tasks provided during the Fawry Internship application.  
I approached each problem carefully, focusing on clean scripting, clear troubleshooting steps, and thorough validation.

## ðŸ“„ Q1: Custom Command - `mygrep.sh`

In this task, I built a **mini version of the `grep` command** using Bash scripting.  
The script `mygrep.sh` supports:

- Searching for a string (case-insensitive).
- Printing matching lines from a text file.
- Showing line numbers with the `-n` option.
- Inverting matches (show non-matching lines) with the `-v` option.
- Supporting combinations like `-vn` or `-nv`.

âœ… I also handled error cases like missing arguments or invalid files, and tested the script with a sample `testfile.txt`.  
You'll find inside the folder:

- The `mygrep.sh` script (executable).
- `testfile.txt` for testing.
- Screenshots showing the script in action.
- A reflection section where I discuss how the script processes arguments, challenges I faced, and how I would expand it to support more features like regex.

## ðŸ“„ Q2: Troubleshooting Scenario - `internal.example.com`

This task focused on **troubleshooting a DNS and service reachability problem**.  
I worked through a real-world scenario where an internal dashboard (`internal.example.com`) became unreachable.

The steps I followed:

1. **DNS Resolution Testing**: Checked local DNS settings and compared them with public DNS (Google 8.8.8.8).
2. **Service Reachability**: Used tools like `curl`, `ping`, `telnet`, and `ss` to check the service.
3. **Problem Root Cause Analysis**: Listed all possible reasons behind the issue (DNS misconfigurations, firewall rules, service downtime, etc.).
4. **Fixes and Verification**: For each potential cause, I explained how to confirm it and how to fix it using Linux commands.

âœ… The folder includes full troubleshooting steps, Linux commands, screenshots of the process, and bonus parts like bypassing DNS temporarily using `/etc/hosts`.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots

Throughout both tasks, I made sure to capture my terminal outputs at every important step to clearly demonstrate and validate my solutions.

## âœ… Final Notes

I enjoyed working on these tasks as they combine practical Linux skills with problem-solving, which are essential in real-world DevOps and system administration roles.  
Thanks for reviewing my work!
